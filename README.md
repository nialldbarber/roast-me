# 🔥 Roast Me 🔥

> An app that rates/roasts local coffee joints.

This is an app that users will be able to rate local coffee shops in their area. After some time user will be able to get a good understanding of where the best roast is near them.

That's the plan, but it's really just a project for me to improve my `node.js` skills and finally create an application using the MERN stack.

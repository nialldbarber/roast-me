# Roast Me

> An app that rates/roasts local coffee joints.

This is an app that users will be able to rate local coffee shops in their area. After some time user will be able to get a good understanding of where the best roast is near them.

That's the plan, but it's really just a project for me to improve my `node.js` skills and finally create an application using the MERN stack.

## What is the MERN stack?!

- M = [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)
- E = [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
- R = [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- N = [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
